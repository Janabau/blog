The goal of Community Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness Program (CP3), a program led by the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), is to strengthen the ability of communities and civil society groups to prevent, detect, and respond to disease threats and play a central and significant role in future risks.

[Data Readiness](https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_CP3_data_readiness_1pager.pdf) is one priority and workstream within CP3. Through this workstream, we want national societies to be equipped to use quality and timely information to influence operations and planning; this is all with the goal of being able to respond effectively to disasters. CP3 relies on the methods and community engagement from the Missing Maps program to create base mapping data for many of the communities where CP3 is active.

**OSM/Missing Maps for Faranah Prefecture, Guinea**

Over the past several months, the CP3 team and the Guinean Red Cross Society (GRCS) mobilized around an extensive activity in community mapping. This has been an extensive multi-step process facilitated by key stakeholders including:

* IFRC
* Geo-Synapse/OSM community and volunteers
* Youth Mappers
* Missing Maps
* American Red Cross
* Guinean Red Cross Society (GRCS)

The different phases of community mapping are outlined below.

**Phase 1: Remote mapping**

Staff and volunteers from the various organizations (most notably from the GRCS and Geo-Synapses) came together and took part in mapathons and worked remotely to populate [buildings and roads](http://taches.francophonelibre.org/?sort_by=priority&direction=asc&search=faranah) in Faranah, Guinea.

**Phase 2: Training and Field Data Collection**

After the remote mapping activity was complete, CP3, GRCS, IFRC, and American Red Cross put together a four-day training for the field data collection activities. The goal of this training was to equip CP3 and GRCS volunteers and staff members with technical skills necessary for a comprehensive data collection process to take place.

During the training, participants were introduced to the [Data Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SGc0y1N0BoCCgYV5qSmtjOtJxpYVOHYD0Ayb-ZF9c24/edit?usp=sharing) that was structured for the collected points of interest to be brought into OSM.

At the end of this field data collection activity, the following features were mapped across all of Faranah prefecture.

|    | Feature Mapped                                                    | Total feature count in Farah |

**Phase 3: Community Validation of the Collected Dataset in the Sub-Prefectures**

In the next phase of this work, there is a scheduled community validation session where GRCS and the CP3 team will sit down with the community to have a conversation about what may be missing and to validate the data that has been collected. Unfortunately, this last step has been delayed due to COVID-19. After this validation process takes place, the data will be uploaded into OSM for public consumption and usage. While we wait to meet with the community for this group validation session, data from the project can be found [here](https://data.humdata.org/search?groups=gin&organization=american-red-cross&q=guinea&ext_page_size=25&sort=score%20desc%2C%20if(gt(last_modified%2Creview_date)%2Clast_modified%2Creview_date)%20desc).

**West Africa Mapping Project**

This is not the first time a Missing Maps activity has taken place in Guinea. Missing Maps was involved with the West Africa Mapping Project that took place in 2016, after the Ebola crisis. [Here](https://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2017/01/24/west-africa-mapping-hub-end/) in this post are some valuable lessons learned from that previous community mapping work in the country.

**The Takeaway**

With this productive collaboration between the major stakeholders, the Guinean Red Cross Society and the Guinea/CP3 staff and volunteers learned how to create their own data in OSM both remotely and via training/data collection. The processes that teams learned in remote mapping, training and field data collection, allowed them to have insight into how mapping data was produced, uploaded, and downloaded from OSM (and other open-data platforms like HDX). 

We hope this post demonstrates our community mapping workflow with other technical teams interested in adding a data collection or map component to their program.

In recent weeks, the national society staff have been creating contingency plans for COVID-19. The dataset compiled during this community mapping exercise allowed the headquarters teams to have a more up-to-date list of border crossing points (including international travel areas) and health facilities for Faranah, both of which are relevant to the current emergency planning and response efforts.
